                            <p>Hello there! Just wondered is anyone out there is using Coolorus? I guess so, anyway, does anyone have the issue where it keeps crashing and the only fix is restarting Photoshop? It works with a mouse, but not tablet. Pretty sure there tablet is still fully functional everywhere else in Photoshop. If so is there a better work-around other than using a different color picker.

So I just bought and install Coolorus (latest version) and when I enter my e-mail and license key it doesn't do anything, just a little wheel to indicate it's searching but then nothing at all, not even an error message :( And it does exactly the same if I try to click on "Trial". Can anyone help me please ? :( Edit : I also tried launching Photoshop as administrator, still doesn't I hope this is the correct place to ask this. As someone who has trouble with colors, I heard that plugins like Coolorus could be helpful. I'm familiar pretty familiar with color theory and don't really have a huge issue with straight values, and it's mostly the application and the inexperience that I'm striving to work past. How exactly do color wheel plugins like Coolorus help make better color decisions? I used up the trial, and well, it seemed like nothing really changed with my color. The current hue cube in Photoshop's color picker uses saturation for its X axis and brightness for its Y axis. As a painter this isn't very useful because some hues like yellow appear brighter to the eye than others, and some darker like blue. This is where the Luminosity or Lightness slider from the LAB mode is useful as it accurately shows perceived value of the colors. What I'm looking for is an extension that can display a hue cube like the default Photoshop color picker or Coolorus' Been having issues ever since I downloaded and installed Coolorus 2.0 on to PS CC 2018. Coolorus is a color wheel extension for Photoshop. Every time I go to draw my line on my Cintiq 27QHD it will immediately be cut off and be forced into the brush settings. Even if I go to my desktop and click or drag around the screen it'll bring up the right click menu. I want to say it has something to do with Coolorus since It was working just fine before. Here's the vid of what's happening. (https://w. 
I hope that I am not breaking any rules but I wanted to let you guys know that Coolorus 2 plugin for PS is on sale (40%). Hi everyone, I'm using the Photoshop color slider extension called "Coolorus." I was thinking it would be very helpful if hardware like this https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/sliders-level-central-red-slide-digital-sound-mixer-portable-buttons-knobs-closeup-48681388.jpg was programmed to control the photoshop color sliders (RGB/HSV) Does anyone know who I would ask about such a job (Or if such a thing would even be possible). Using CC and my trial for Coolorus expired, so I'm trying to find a painter/colour wheel for digital painting. If anyone uses a free colour wheel for CC, please let me know where to get it. Thanks. Does anyone have a good list of recommendations for digital tools? I've seen people using coolorus, warm cool, and that brush pack by that guy on gumroad, Kyle I think. Are there any other killer tools. found it useful in coolorus, would be nice to have it in future updates. Hi guys, It seems that the extension panel in photoshop (currently using 2015.5 on mac) is not color-managed. Plugins like Adobe Color Themes (formerly Kuler) or Coolorus don't seem to be usable with an AdobeRGB or a prophotoRGB profiled image because the hex values given by these plugins obviously don't match the values in a different color space. Soft proofing my image with a different profile shows that the extension panel seems to work in a standard sRGB space, like web browsers. Which.

As somebody who uses Photoshop to Draw/paint, I've always used the Liquify function to tweak sketches or linework. However, recently I've been experiencing an issue. I utilize liquefy, and the colors of the sketch are distorted when the liquefy window closes and the changes apply. Here' I've got some images of the problem. This is the sketch, before doing anything. ( We use liquify and. ( This is what comes out!! (http://imgur.com/VDuM7. Upgraded, tried to install Coolorus 2.5.7 to it, I gain a "undefined is not an object" error message. Anyone have any insight on this?

I also included Coolorus which I love to use as well. Alla Prima II is hands down the best book ever on painting. The Art Spirit, because I just love to read about art philosophy.

A couple weeks ago I downloaded a trial for a color wheel extension known as Coolorus. It is paid software, and since I was satisfied with the trial, I decided to give it a purchase. Except I can't. I input my card information(and yes, I've checked to make it's inputted correctly) and they straight up refuse to take my money for some reason. That reason I'm assuming is "2000 Do Not Honor" I am not sure what it means but here is some information about my card that makes me scratch my head wonde. I bought Coolorus for photoshop cs5 originally In Janurary, then in March I bought photoshop CC. I can't seem to use Coolorus in CC but it still works in photoshop cs5! Is there a way to transfer it? also, I had Coolorus 1.0 then today, I bought 2.0 hoping it would install in CC automatically somehow. I got a file in zpx format And it opens up in adobe extension manager cs6, but I don't have cs6 only CC, how do I install Coolorus for photoshop CC!?!?!
