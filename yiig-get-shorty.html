I'm enjoying it so much I felt the need to go online and say it. Super compelling, well acted, funny and tense. I don't know it's gotten much attention but check it out so that maybe we can't get more. MOOOORE. 
I cant believe how unknown it is, Im not going to make ridiculous claims like "criminally underrated" (what the hell does that even mean?) but its such a great piece of television. And its on freaking Epix of all services, EPIX! Forget the show, I know more people that know the show than they know the streaming service. Without getting completely off track, this show feels like as if they took Breaking Bad and mixed it with a Coen brothers movie. It's whackier and somehow makes degenerate chara. The character development and story arcs are so well done in this show. Some of the scenes had me shouting Holy Crap! Did that just happen.? And that dark humour.So. It shares very little DNA with the Hackman/Travolta/DeVito Movie. I’m enjoying it more than Fargo Season 1, which is an all time favorite of mine. It’s got a similar tone, with a faster pace and even some elements of Breaking Bad. The camera work is phenomenal, despite the low budget. It ranges from making me laugh out loud to cutting off the circulation in my wife’s hand from the tension. The writing feels very inspired by the Coen Brothers style. It’s all around amazing. Constant subversio. So I personally enjoyed the 1995 movie "Get Shorty" with Travolta. Fun comedy, with an unusual tone. The 2017 TV series is nothing like the movie. It's better. They took the story to a drama angle, it's a brilliant mix of Breaking Bad, Episodes, with a touch of Fargo. I can't stress enough how good this is. Fair warning, there's nudity and gunshots, superb shots and a rather simple straight forward plotline. It isn't the best show ever, but if you miss Breaking Bad, give this a try. Can't. One second he was everywhere in the first series, but then he seemed to disappear. Was he killed off (& I missed it) or did he ask for a pay rise or something & they chucked I'm not as caught up as most Barry fans, but I noticed right from the beginning that they're both dark comedies, and the protagonist >!unexpectedly feels drawn to the entertainment industry shortly before or after arriving in L.A.!< (the mildest of spoilers, but just in case.) Of course if you've heard of Get Shorty you would already know. I think it's criminally underrated. I saw this film recently since I heard it was one of the better films of that year. While I still have more films to watch to verify that claim, I liked the film especially as someone who was interested in the movie business myself. Barry Sonnenfeld does swell as a director and does great work with the cast. Speaking of which, while I enjoyed everyone in the film, including producer Danny DeVito, it certainly reminds me why I admire John Travolta of all of them as an actor. They had multiple characters "pressing" and drinking Juicero in the final episode, with lots of product shots, and all of the characters expressing at how delicious the found each individual flavour. The problem is that Juicero is out of business. 
I just wanted to thank all of you for recommending Get Shorty. I blew through both seasons in the span of a few days and I’m already anticipating season 3! Y’all literally recommend the best hidden gems. Plot. Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is a loan shark based in Miami who clashes with mobster Ray Bones Barboni (Dennis Farina) over a leather jacket that Bones. Get Shorty is a 1990 novel by American novelist Elmore Leonard.

Watch trailers. Get Shorty Critics Consensus. With a perfect cast and a sly twist on the usual Hollywood gangster dynamic, Get Shorty delivers a sharp satire that doubles Critics Consensus: Get Shorty's slick production values are complemented by its seasoned cast's chemistry to create a fun-filled, if violent, first season that lives. 
Get Shorty un film del 1995, diretto da Barry Sonnenfeld, con John Travolta e Gene Hackman. l'adattamento del romanzo La scorciatoia (Get Shorty) di Elmore Leonard. The first Elmore Leonard adaptation widely considered to be as good as the book, Get Shorty continued John Travolta’s return to box office prominence.
