 Just wanted to put this to other Rift owners - or just those with other VR headsets - what are some good games right now to pick up. I got the Rift about two years ago and had enjoyed Robo Recall, Air Car, the Alien Isolation mod along with the Doom 3 mod - but I kind of dropped out of VR for awhile and haven't been keeping up with the scene but now am looking to get back in again. So what's good game and mod wise - thanks. Hi, I got the vive back at launch, and played the shit out of it. However, after the honey moon phase I started to use my playspace for a small weed grow (was just legalized for recreational use so I couldnt pass that up), and then my wife started to turn the rest of the room into storage. Anyways, we just moved and I have a dedicated playspace agaim and just setup the vive. What should I check out first? Whats the best games that came out in the last year? I used to love Hover Junkies hi guys, I was googling and couldn't find any. Then I googled for any kind of (quality) simulator except for farming or flight - another failure. Could you advice? Cheers \ EDIT / OFF: Why my question gets downvoted? Seriously. What's all the salt for? I'm so sorry for asking questions on reddit. seriously.\. Blake J. Harris has released his new book chronicling the history of Oculus. Like his book Console Wars, recounting the war between Sega and Nintendo in the 90s, it's super entertaining because Blake writes more in a "prose" way. I recommend the book to any VR fan. Obviously there's some Valve/HTC history in there as well. Anyway, what I came here for, is to ask: What are the currently "hot" games for the Vive? I haven't played with mine for about a year. I am embarrassed to admit, but VR turne. Hi, I am curious what's your favourite games so far on VR? Mine: Moss Rick and Morty Accountant Tales of Wedding Rings (More experience than a game) Superhot Duck Season The unspoken Edge of nowhere Fated the silent. Ok so past couple years I have been trying to make a submarine simulator (something I am very passionate and focused on making) but its a very extreme project for one programmer. I have tried recruiting my irl's that may have an interest but they are all too busy. I would get so far in the development cycle then look at the code and be horrified that I actually wrote it like that. Im learning a lot of different and more efficient ways to write this code so its just part of the cycle I guess. I've really had an itch to play a game where you control a submarine and, preferably, can walk around in it. Subnautica seems great for this, but the Subnautica world is only 2km wide, from what I have read. That's just not large enough for the sense of scale I desire for ocean exploration. I've seen some submarine simulators that appear to be combat mission-focused, but I'm really more interested in the exploration and lifestyle side of things. Does anyone know of a submarine exploration. 
Platform(s): PC Genre: Estimated year of release: Somewhere in the late 2000s, probably Graphics/art style: It's pretty simple, like in the old games, boxes and a bunch of text. Notable characters: \- Notable gameplay mechanics: Fully simulated submarine, fires, flooding, manual operating of torpedo launchers and other equipment, simulated map with ?travelling? , randomized names For every behemoth, there's a map where that behemoth is crashed/wrecked/disabled. The airship crashed on Giant's Shadow. The Dreadnought was taken down in the Suez canal. The Char 2C was stopped in Nivelle Nights. The Armored Train derailed in Volga river. EDIT: Mixed up Volga river and Galicia for the train. The main thing I remember was the opening cinematic. It starts off with a few submarines lurking beneath the ocean. Suddenly you see tons of depth charges being dropped, some narrowly avoiding your sub. One other sub isn't so lucky and is destroyed. I don't remember much after that, but I remember it ends with your sub shooting a torpedo and destroying of the ships. Thanks. First off, I understand the surface is not a gaming laptop. However, it is a fairly powerful device and I would like to get the most out of it! I have the surface pro 4 i5, 4GB, 128SSD model. What games could I run on this that I could get on steam or even with the xbox play anywhere program? Or even apps! I'm open to anything. I mean come on this is space. There is no such thing like seperation of sound. Pretty sure it was only available on PC as there was a lot of clicking and switching menus, pulling levels, dials etc. Submarine Simulator: Must have been from the late 90s to early 2000s: Pretty good graphics for the time. I remember you could see your submarine and view it from any angle as it was in the water: I don't remember any story at all, but that may just be me not remembering: I remember a cool moment for me was when my submarine got stuck, and there We already know of Octodad and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime , do you have any suggestions about something else in the same vein? It can be any kind of games. Thank. A submarine simulator is usually a computer game in which the player commands a submarine. The usual form of the game is to go on a series of missions, each of which.
